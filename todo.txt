Install git server:
------------------

1. Plug in two microSD cards and get correct device names:

	lsblk

2. Install the OS and some configuration onto both microSD cards:

	.gc/new-git-server.sh -RFf /dev/sdd

	.gc/new-git-server.sh -RFf /dev/sde

3. Remove one of the microSD cards, place it into a server, and turn it on. 
   Wait for the server to bootstrap and start running (~16 minutes):

	while [ true ]; do .gc/git-servers.sh; sleep 10; echo ""; done

4. Wait for the above command to output "http://git1:1234", then run the 
   following to assign the next available hostname to the next server's
   microSD card:

	.gc/new-git-server-setup.sh -RFf /dev/sde

   The output should say this server has been assigned the hostname "git2".
   If it says "git1" instead, wait a bit longer and try running the above
   command again until it outputs "git2".

5. Remove the second microSD card and place it into the second server, and
   turn it on.

6. Wait for the second server to bootstrap and start running (~16 minutes):
   
	while [ true ]; do .gc/git-servers.sh; sleep 10; echo ""; done

   Once the above command starts outputting both servers, your new git servers
   are ready to use. It should look like this:

	http://git1:1234
	http://git2:1234

7. Click those links in the terminal to open the web UI for each server, or
   run this command to open them in your default web browser automatically:

	.gc/git-servers-open.sh
